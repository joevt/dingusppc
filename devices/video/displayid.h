/** @file DisplayID class definitions.

    DisplayID is a special purpose class for handling display
    identification (aka Monitor Plug-n-Play) as required by
    video cards.

    DisplayID provides two methods for display identification:
    - Apple monitor sense as described in the Technical Note HW30
    - Display Data Channel (DDC) standardized by VESA
